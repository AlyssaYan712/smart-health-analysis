# 🧠 Smart Health Analysis

This project is part of my HealthTech Data Analyst portfolio. It focuses on cleaning and merging clinical-style datasets from NHANES (2021–2023) — simulating how health IoT (Internet of Health Things) systems can use diet and biomarkers to assess patient risk.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using Python (Pandas & NumPy), I processed four datasets:
- **Dietary Intake** (protein, fiber, moisture)
- **Plasma Glucose** (fasting blood sugar)
- **Ferritin** (iron levels)
- **Vitamin D** (immune/metabolic health)

The goal was to:
- Merge the datasets by participant ID (SEQN)
- Clean missing values
- Output a clean CSV file for downstream analysis (e.g. Power BI or Tableau dashboarding, risk modeling)

## ⚙️ Tools & Skills

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data cleaning and merging
- CSV output for visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI)
- Healthcare data handling logic

## 📁 Files

- `Data cleaning_and module for IoHT_updated.ipynb` – full cleaning and merge logic
- `Cleaned_and_Merged_Dataset.csv` – clean output (not uploaded for privacy but used in downstream modeling)

## 📊 Next Steps

The cleaned dataset is used in:
- A **health risk scoring model** (linear + logistic regression)
- An **interactive Tableau dashboard** that translates raw data into intuitive visuals for non-technical users
